Some tests to evaluate variational inference. There tests are based on those reported in,

Namely, the test which uses the PSIS k diagnostic, and the test which uses the VSBC diagnostic. 

The R implementations of these diagnostics are given in this repo, which should be generalizable to any stan model.
